#Target list of features, in priority order
- Vectors (2, 3, 4, plus their operations)
- Matrices (2x2, 3x3, 4x4 at least, plus their operations)
- Basic functions (normalize, length, transposition, dot, cross)
- Conventions: right-handed, row major, float default
- Quaternions
- simd optimization
- Double vs. float vs. other types (bound float and double i.e. float16, float32, etc.)
